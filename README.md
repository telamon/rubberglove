# Rubberglove

The doctor said that I have Microsoftophobia.

Besides having severe a "click"-allergy especially in combination with "advanced"-buttons,
the doctors orders were to avoid:

* strict/static-typing
* RetardedCamel-Case
* Anything that matches /^Visual/i
* Sharpthings

And In order to prolong my lifespan I'm supposed to try and get a daily dose of Gnu-GPL and wear **Rubbergloves** at all times.

Check back later.
